# Data Analyst Portfolio

Hello, this is a repository for data science projects I have completed in my free time. I work as a data analyst at a software healthcare company with confidential data (PHI), so I created this to showcase skills with data that is free and open to the public.

### Crypto data analysis and visualization automated from an API
**Code:** [`Data_Analysis_Crypto_API.ipynb`]([https://github.com/sophielindsay/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Data_Analysis_Crypto_API.ipynb])   
**Description:** The dataset contains records pulled from a public crypto API (https://coinmarketcap.com/api/). Using an API key with Python, the API JSON format gets converted to a readable data frame with Pandas. The data is automated to pull new data and append it to a csv every minute, so the crypto metrics can be analyzed over time. The dataframes are transformed into readable data that gets transformed into readable tables and visualizations to make conclusions about the Crypto market.<br>
**Technology:** Python, Json, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
